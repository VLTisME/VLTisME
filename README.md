## About Me
Hi, my name is Võ Lân Tuấn, you can call me **pengon**, and I'm a freshman at VNUHCM - University of Science.

I have _a solitary soul, echoing through every melancholic melody._

## My Passions  

Currently, I'm learning about AI in general and computer vision in particular. I'm also taking an intensive course in MLOps, hoping to gain valuable insights from it. Additionally, I do some works related to competitive programming, such as preparing problems and participating in competitions ^_^.
